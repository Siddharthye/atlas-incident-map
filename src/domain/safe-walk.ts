 * SAFE WALK — a dead man's switch for walking home.
 *
 * You tell AEGIS where you are going and how long it should take. It asks you
 * to check in on the way. Miss enough check-ins, or overrun your ETA badly
 * enough, and it escalates on its own — because the situation this exists for
 * is precisely the one where you cannot reach for your phone.
 *
 * Escalation is *computed*, never scheduled. A `setTimeout` ladder silently
 * never fires on serverless, so overdue state is derived from timestamps on
 * every read — the same doctrine the SLA clock and alert escalation use.
