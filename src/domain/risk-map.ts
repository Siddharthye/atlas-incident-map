 * SIGHTLINE — what the incident corpus knows that no individual reporter does.
 *
 * A student who was followed once on the north path thinks it was bad luck. A
 * student followed twice thinks they are unlucky. Neither of them can know
 * that six *other* people reported the same thing, on the same stretch,
 * between nine and midnight, this month — because each of those reports went
 * to the control room and stopped there.
 *
 * This module reads the whole corpus and answers two questions no consumer
 * app can answer, because no consumer app holds the corpus:
 *
 *   1. Where do incidents repeat, at what hours, reported by *different*
 *      people? (`detectPatterns`)
 *   2. Given those patterns, which way should someone walk right now?
 *      (`rankRoutesBySafety`)
 *
 * Everything here is pure, so the reasoning behind a routing suggestion can be
 * unit-tested and defended rather than trusted.
